                <p>"Mafia" is a party game in which a group of players are secretly divided into two teams: the mafia and the townspeople, and must try to eliminate the members of the other team through a series of discussions and voting.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Divide the class into two teams: the mafia and the townspeople. The number of players on each team will depend on the size of the class. It's generally best to have more townspeople than mafia, but the exact ratio will depend on the group (1 or 2 mafia for a group of 10).</li>
                <li>One player is designated as the moderator. There task is to assign roles, ensure the day phases aren't too long, and the night phases are used correctly.</li>
                <li>Each player is secretly assigned a role: mafia, townsperson, or special role (e.g. detective, doctor).</li>
                <li>During the day phase, the class discusses and tries to figure out who among them is in the mafia. The townspeople can ask questions and try to determine who is telling the truth.</li>
                <li>At night, the mafia members secretly choose one townsperson to "eliminate." The detective (if there is one) can secretly choose one player to investigate. The doctor (if there is one) can select one player to save.</li>
                <li>In the morning, the eliminated player is revealed, and if they were saved or not (if there is a doctor). The class then discusses and tries to figure out who the mafia members are based on the clues from the previous night and the day's discussions.</li>
                <li>Play continues until either all of the mafia members have been identified and eliminated, or the mafia outnumbers the townspeople.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Variations include...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To make the game more challenging, you can add more mafia members or special roles, or give the mafia more powers (e.g. the ability to eliminate two townspeople per night). You can also vary the length of the day and night phases to suit the group. It's important to have a moderator to keep the game moving and enforce the rules.</li>
